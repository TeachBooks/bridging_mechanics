(lesson1.3)=
# Lesson Friday September 6th

As a preparation [you graded your own prerequisite test](homework1.3). Furthermore, I graded your work as well. Today we'll discuss the results. If there's time left, you can start working on next week homework deadline.

## Discuss prerequisite tests
Today we'll discuss the outcomes of the prerequisite tests; we'll discuss how assignments were made by average and which mistakes are worth mentioning. If I've graded your work differently than you did yourself, there's time available to discuss in class.

Following, you'll be asked to make a knowledge graph of the topics which you encountered in the prerequisite tests, and how they link to the learning objectives of this course. An example is shown below:

Then, we'll discuss the structure of the prerequisite material as demonstrated in this book ordered by class-activities and the full overview of all the content on [https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc).

## Start homework deadline for next week
If we've time left, you can start preparing for the first homework deadline on [Statics externally](homework2.2) which you'll need to apply in class on next Wednesday
