# Preparation exam Friday November 8th

As a preparation for the first assignment you can repeat all the topics of Statically indeterminate structures, including the prerequisites. This is shown all content from Week 3 Friday to Week 8 Friday. This can also be shown in structure per topic in the [Mechanics-BSc book](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc):

- [Prerequisites statics](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc/support_internal_forces/intro.html): all topics except for `Solve section forces ... using differential equations`.
- [Stresses and displacements](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc/stresses_displacements/intro.html): all topics except for `Cross-sectional properties` and `Solve displacements ... using differential equations`.
- [Statically indeterminate structures](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc/statically_inderminate/intro.html)

Repeat those topics which you have difficulty with. If you've any questions along the way, please visit the TAs in 6.41 during lunch time.
