# Lesson Friday September 6th <br> {bdg-secondary-line}`Prerequisites`

As a preparation [you graded your own prerequisite test](homework1.3). Furthermore, I graded your work as well. Today we'll discuss the results. If there's time left, you can start working on next week homework deadline.

## Discuss prerequisite tests
Today we'll discuss the outcomes of the prerequisite tests; we'll discuss how assignments were made by average and which mistakes are worth mentioning. If I've graded your work differently than you did yourself, there's time available to discuss in class.

Then, we'll discuss the structure of the prerequisite material as demonstrated in this this book by activities labelled with {bdg-secondary}`Prerequisites` and the full overview of all the content on [https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc).

## Start homework deadline for next week
If we've time left, you can start preparing for the first {bdg-secondary}`Prerequisites`-deadline on [Statics](homework2.2) which you'll need to apply in class on next Wednesday
