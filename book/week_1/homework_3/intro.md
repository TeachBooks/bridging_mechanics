# Homework deadline lesson Friday September 6th

As a preparation for [Friday's lesson](lesson1.3) you'll be asked to grade your test yourself on paper using the provided model-answer. During that lesson we'll discuss the results to identify which topics you should spend more time on during this quarter.

## Grade your test
You can view test including the model answer as soon as it is scanned at:

- [<img height="12px" src="../../figures/ANS.svg" alt="ANS"> prerequisite test 1](https://ans.app/universities/1/courses/437261/assignments/1083762/go_to)
- [<img height="12px" src="../../figures/ANS.svg" alt="ANS"> prerequisite test 2](https://ans.app/universities/1/courses/437261/assignments/1084137/go_to).

The model answer includes the levels to select for grading. You'll grade your prerequisite tests yourselves. Unfortunately that's not possible from within the ANS environment. However, I'm curious to your own grading, so you can submit your grade via:
- [<img height="18px" src="../../figures/Microsoft_Forms.svg" alt="Microsoft Forms"> form prerequisite test 1](https://forms.office.com/e/viiL8VkwWy).
- [<img height="18px" src="../../figures/Microsoft_Forms.svg" alt="Microsoft Forms"> form prerequisite test 2](https://forms.office.com/e/PxYUsRqhei).

You can that directly after your prerequisite tests are scanned. After you submit your grading, please save the link provided in the summary screen to be able to view and edit your grading at a later stage.
