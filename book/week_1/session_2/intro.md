## Prerequisite test 2
Today we'll continue with the second prerequisite test. Again, this will offer both an overview of the expected prerequisite knowledge and allows you to check whether you master those topics. This test won't count for your final grade of this course but is meant to give you insight in your learning.

Try to do this exercise on your own. If you cannot proceed, you're free to discuss the exercise with your fellow students and the teacher. If you do so, indicate how this helped you so that it's clear which topics you do or do not master.

Afterwards, you're test will be scanned so that I can have some insights in your performance as well. However, you'll be asked to grade your test yourself on paper using the provided model-answer as a [preparation](homework1.3) for the lesson on Friday. During that lesson we'll discuss the results to identify which topics you should spend more time on during this quarter.
