# Preparation exam Friday November 8th

As a preparation for the first assignment you can repeat all the topics of Statically indeterminate structures, including the prerequisites. This content can be viewed at:
- All content from Week 3 Friday to Week 8 Friday in this book
- The stripped version of the [Mechanics-BSc book](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc/2024-assignment1) book (url includes `/2024-assignment1`).
- The following chapters of the full [Mechanics-BSc book](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc), except for:
    - [Prerequisites statics](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc/support_internal_forces/intro.html): all topics except for `Differential equations for equilibrium relations` and `Solve section forces ... using differential equations`.
    - [Stresses and displacements](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc/stresses_displacements/intro.html): all topics except for `Cross-sectional properties` and `Solve displacements ... using differential equations`.
    - [Statically indeterminate structures](https://teachbooks.github.io/mechanics-BSc/statically_inderminate/intro.html)

Repeat those topics which you have difficulty with. If you've any questions along the way, please visit the TAs in 6.41 during lunch time.
