# Homework deadline lesson Friday September 6th <br> {bdg-secondary}`Prerequisites`

As a preparation for [Friday's lesson](lesson1.3) you'll be asked to grade your test yourself on paper using the provided model-answer. During that lesson we'll discuss the results to identify which topics you should spend more time on during this quarter

## Grade your test
You can view your scanned test including the model answer in ANS (LINK TO BE ADDED). The model answer includes the levels to select for grading.  You'll grade your prerequisite tests yourselves. Unfortunately that's not possible from within the ANS environment. However, I'm curious to your own grading, so you can submit your grade via this [online form](https://forms.office.com/e/viiL8VkwWy). You can that directly after your prerequisite test 1 is scanned, and add the grading of prerequisite test 2 later. After you submit your grading, please save the link provided in the summary screen to be able to view and edit your grading at a later stage.
